This project is all about predicting the number of people survived in a Titanic Accident.
First I have imported all the necessary libraries .This includes numpy,pandas,matplot,seaborn,sklearn
Then I have loaded the data which I was downloaded from Kaggle.
Handled missing value by replacing them with mean,mode .And also removed the coloumn whose missing value is larger.
Performed Data Analysis by plotting graph to know number of survivors based on gender and so on.
Encoding the Categorical column.Converted string  into binary values.
Splitted the data into train data and test data.
Trained the model using Logistic Regression.Atlast Evaluated the model by using Accuracy score .
